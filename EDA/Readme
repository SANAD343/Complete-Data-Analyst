# Summary of EDA on the Titanic Dataset

The Titanic dataset is one of the most well-known datasets used for classification tasks. 
It contains details of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, and the goal is to predict survival based on various factors. 

Hereâ€™s a brief summary of the EDA process:

# Dataset Overview:
Columns:
*Survived: Binary indicator (0 = No, 1 = Yes), whether the passenger survived.
*Pclass: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
*Sex: Gender of the passenger.
*Age: Age of the passenger.
*Fare: The ticket price paid.
*Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
*SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
*Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.

Key Insights from EDA:
Survival Rate:
Overall Survival Rate: Approximately 38% of passengers survived the disaster.

Impact of Passenger Class (Pclass):
Higher survival rates in 1st Class: Passengers in 1st class had a better chance of survival compared to those in 2nd and 3rd class. 
Over 60% of 1st class passengers survived, while only 24% of 3rd class passengers survived.

Gender and Survival:
Women had higher survival rates: About 74% of female passengers survived, compared to only 18% of male passengers.

Age Distribution:
Children had higher survival rates: Younger passengers (especially children) had higher survival rates, while older passengers were less likely to survive.
The average age of passengers was around 29 years, with children under 10 having a significantly higher survival rate.

Fare and Survival:
Higher fares correlated with higher survival: Passengers who paid higher fares, typically in higher classes, had a greater chance of survival.

Embarkation Point:
Survival rates differed by embarkation point: Passengers who embarked from Cherbourg (C) had a higher survival rate, while those from Southampton (S) had a lower survival rate.

Missing Data:
The Age column had several missing values, which were imputed using techniques like mean or median.
Embarked had a few missing values that were filled with the most frequent value.

Conclusion:
EDA on the Titanic dataset reveals that factors such as class, gender, age, and fare played significant roles in determining survival. 
Women and children, as well as those in higher classes, had much better survival odds. 
These insights provide a foundation for building predictive models to classify whether a passenger would survive or not.
