Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Red Wine Quality Dataset

Overview

The Red Wine Quality Dataset contains various chemical properties of red wine, with an associated quality score given by wine experts. 
The goal of the EDA is to analyze these features and discover key patterns and relationships that affect wine quality.

Dataset Information

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
Rows: 1599 samples (individual wine records)
Columns: 12 (11 chemical properties + 1 target variable)

Features:

Fixed Acidity: Acidity from non-volatile acids, impacting the taste.
Volatile Acidity: High levels lead to unpleasant tastes.
Citric Acid: Adds freshness and flavor to wines.
Residual Sugar: The remaining sugar after fermentation.
Chlorides: Salt content in the wine.
Free Sulfur Dioxide: Prevents microbial growth and oxidation.
Total Sulfur Dioxide: Free + bound forms of sulfur dioxide.
Density: Related to the alcohol and sugar content.
pH: Level of acidity or alkalinity.
Sulphates: Adds to the bitterness and enhances flavor.
Alcohol: Alcohol content by volume.
Quality: Target variable, ranges from 0 (worst) to 10 (best), representing expert ratings.

EDA Objectives

Understand the distribution of wine quality and assess how different chemical properties correlate with it.
Identify important features that significantly affect the quality of wine.
Visualize relationships between chemical properties and their impact on wine quality.
Handle missing data (if any), outliers, and clean the dataset for further analysis.

Key Insights from EDA

1. Quality Distribution:
Majority of wines fall between quality ratings 5 and 6. Very few wines are rated as 8 or higher.

2. Alcohol Content:
Higher alcohol content is associated with better wine quality. Wines with higher ratings (7-8) tend to have higher alcohol percentages.

3. Volatile Acidity:
Negative correlation with quality. Wines with high volatile acidity (which imparts a vinegar-like taste) generally receive lower ratings.

4. Citric Acid:
Wines with moderate levels of citric acid are rated higher, suggesting a positive influence on wine quality.

5. Sulfur Dioxide (SO2):
Excessive sulfur dioxide levels negatively impact quality, while wines with balanced SO2 levels perform better in terms of quality ratings.

6. Residual Sugar:
Little to no correlation with wine quality, meaning sweetness does not significantly affect the expert's ratings.

7. pH Levels:
The majority of wines have a pH range between 3.0 and 3.5. Wines with more balanced pH levels tend to have higher quality scores.

Steps Performed in EDA

Data Loading and Initial Inspection:
Load the dataset and check for missing values, data types, and basic statistics of each feature.

Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values (if any) and check for outliers in key features (e.g., alcohol, acidity).

Univariate Analysis:
Visualize the distribution of each feature (e.g., histograms for alcohol, acidity, etc.).
Examine the overall quality distribution to understand class imbalances.

Bivariate Analysis:
Use scatter plots and correlation matrices to study the relationship between features like alcohol content, acidity, and wine quality.
Heatmap visualization of correlations between variables.

Feature Correlation:
Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficients to identify which features (e.g., alcohol, volatile acidity) have the most influence on wine quality.

Data Visualization:
Utilize box plots, histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to visualize data distribution, trends, and correlations.

Conclusion

The EDA revealed several significant findings:

- Alcohol content and volatile acidity are strong indicators of wine quality.
- Citric acid positively influences the wineâ€™s perceived quality.
- Balancing the levels of sulfur dioxide improves wine ratings, while residual sugar and pH have less impact on quality.
